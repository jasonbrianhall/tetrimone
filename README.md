# GTK Tetris: Pixel-Dropping Pandemonium! üß©üöÄ

## Overview

Prepare for a block-stacking adventure that'll make your neurons dance! GTK Tetris is a pulse-pounding reimagining of the classic puzzle game, powered by GTK+, SDL, and flexible audio backends. Warning: May cause sudden outbursts of strategic genius and controller-gripping intensity!

## Features

### Gameplay Madness
- **Classic Tetris Mechanics**: Because some legends never die
- **Keyboard Ninja Controls**: Move, rotate, and drop with lightning reflexes
- **Gamepad Support**: For those who prefer their tetrominos with analog swagger
- **20 Color Themes**: Watch your world transform as you level up
- **Difficulty Levels**: From "Casual Puzzler" to "Tetris Terminator"

### Audio Awesomeness
- **Pumping Background Music**: Powered by PulseAudio or SDL2 audio
- **Sound Effects**: Every block drop, rotation, and line clear has its own sonic personality
- **Mute Button**: For when you need to sneak in some tetromino action

## Controls

### Keyboard Warriors
- **Left/Right Arrow or A/D**: Slide those blocks
- **Up Arrow or W**: Rotate clockwise
- **Z**: Rotate counter-clockwise
- **Down Arrow or S**: Soft drop for the impatient

- **B Button**: Rotate counter-clockwise
- **Start Button**: Game control central

## Installation Dependencies

### Required Libraries
- GTK+ 3.0
- SDL2 (for joystick support)

- PulseAudio (optional; see above)
- libzip

### Compilation Arsenal
- CMake or Make
- C++17 or later compiler

## Build Instructions

### Linux Tetris Taming

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
# Summon the dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libpulse-dev libzip-dev gcc g++ make

# Clone the block-dropping battlefield
git clone https://github.com/jasonbrianhall/tetris.git
cd tetris

# Build with default SDL audio
make

# Alternative build options:
# make sdl           # Explicitly use SDL audio
# make pulse         # Use PulseAudio (still uses SDL for joystick)
# make debug         # Build with debug symbols
# make sdl-debug     # Debug build with SDL audio
# make pulse-debug   # Debug build with PulseAudio
```

#### Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
```bash
# Summon the dependencies
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel SDL2-devel SDL2_mixer-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel libzip-devel gcc-c++

# Clone the block-dropping battlefield
git clone https://github.com/jasonbrianhall/tetris.git
cd tetris

# Build with default SDL audio
make

# Alternative build options:
# make sdl           # Explicitly use SDL audio
# make pulse         # Use PulseAudio (still uses SDL for joystick)
# make debug         # Build with debug symbols
# make sdl-debug     # Debug build with SDL audio
# make pulse-debug   # Debug build with PulseAudio
```

## Scoring: The Tetris Triumph Scale

## TODO

* Thought about multiplayer support but didn't really architect it for MP support.  Would require a great deal of reengineering.
