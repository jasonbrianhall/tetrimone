# GTK Tetrimone: Pixel-Dropping Pandemonium! üß©üöÄ

## Tetrimone: The Perfect Fusion of Gaming Elements

### Tetrimone Meaning

"Tetrimone" brilliantly combines "tetromino" (the four-block geometric pieces that are the heart of the gameplay) with a hint of "metronome" (suggesting the rhythmic, pulse-pounding timing that drives the game forward).

This ingenious portmanteau captures the essence of what makes the game so addictive‚Äîgeometric precision meeting musical rhythm in a perfect harmony of gaming elements. The name evokes both the mathematical elegance of the falling shapes and the escalating tempo that challenges players as they progress through levels.

The "-one" suffix also subtly suggests "the one"‚Äîpositioning this as the definitive, ultimate version of the classic block-dropping experience. It's not just another clone; it's a reimagining that honors the legacy while carving its own unique identity in the puzzle game pantheon.

Tetrimone stands as a testament to gaming history while boldly facing the future‚Äîeach carefully placed block building not just toward line clears, but toward gaming greatness!

## Overview

Prepare for a block-stacking adventure that'll make your neurons dance! GTK Tetrimone is a pulse-pounding reimagining of the classic puzzle game, powered by GTK+, SDL, and flexible audio backends. Warning: May cause sudden outbursts of strategic genius and controller-gripping intensity!

## Features

### Gameplay Madness
- **Classic Tetrimone Mechanics**: Because some legends never die
- **Keyboard Ninja Controls**: Move, rotate, and drop with lightning reflexes
- **Gamepad Support**: For those who prefer their tetrominos with analog swagger
- **30 Color Themes**: Watch your world transform as you level up
- **Difficulty Levels**: From "Casual Puzzler" to "Tetrimone Terminator"
- **Initial Block Level**: From 0-50%; Punish yourself with higher initial junk blocks.
- **Blocks Per Level**: Add anywhere from zero to five junk lines per level; the higher the number, the faster you lose.
- **Control Block Shapes**: Initial settings include mononomes, dominoes, triominoes, and tetrominoes.  Don't like mononomes, domnioes, or triominoes, remove them.
- **Retro Blocks**: You like retro blocks, configure it.

### Audio Awesomeness
- **Pumping Background Music**: Powered by PulseAudio or SDL2 audio
- **Sound Effects**: Every block drop, rotation, and line clear has its own sonic personality
- **Mute Button**: For when you need to sneak in some tetromino action
- **Retro Music Support**: Wrote a classic MIDI player that plays 8 bit sounds (based on DOSBOX's excellent OPL3SA emulation and some QBASIC code I tactically acquired and converted to C).  Feel like the MS-DOS days.  **NOTE**:  Current music must play through one time for it to change until I fix that.
- **Custom Music support**: If you don't like the themes, their is a sound.zip file, simply replace with your own music and and sound (mp3, midi, and wav support).  Must use midi for retromode.

### üé¨ Animation Spectacular: Where Blocks Come Alive! ‚ú®

#### Smooth Movement System
Your tetrominos don't just teleport‚Äîthey **glide** with cinematic grace! Every piece movement is interpolated with silky-smooth 60 FPS animations using advanced easing functions. Watch as your blocks flow across the grid like digital poetry in motion.

## TODO

* Thought about multiplayer support but didn't really architect it for MP support.  Would require a great deal of reengineering.
